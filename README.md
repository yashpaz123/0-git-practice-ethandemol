## Why I Found This Interesting

I chose this article because Bending Spoons is a unusual company, and the article offers insight into how it operates. At a high level, it sits at the intersection of a software company and a private-equity-style operator. They combine product development with a highly quantitative and disciplined acquisition strategy. Their rigorous hiring process and strong emphasis on efficiency and long-term value creation contrasts with the aggressive expansion mindset common in much of the tech industry and it's proven to pay dividend in the long run as their valuation keeps rising. Great founder story as well; well worth a read.
